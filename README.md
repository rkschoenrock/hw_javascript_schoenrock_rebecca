## Resources

[W3 Schools JS Functions](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) - I read more about the syntax and ivoking functions.

[W3 Schools Parameters and Arguments](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp) - This helped me break down the parts of a function and what the difference between parameters and arguments are.

## Comments

I used a `console.log` in 6.3 to invoke the message, but I didn't return the `function inception` at all and couldn't figure out how to use `inception` to get rid of the no-unused-vars error.

The instructions never stated whether or not to merge the branches, so I kept each branch separate from the master branch.
